# Statistical Methods

In this repo, I delve into some of the core concepts of **Statistics** I took in the courses _"Statistics"_ and _"Advanced Statistics and Applications in Engineering"_ during my [BSc](https://github.com/GBlanch/Portfolio/blob/main/0.Files/A.Transcripts/0.WES%20Course-by-Course%20report/readme.md). 

 + [BGD for a Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/GBlanch/Statistical-Methods/blob/main/0.Simple%20Linear%20Regression/Cost-Loss%20Funct.%20and%20BGD.ipynb)
 + [Time-Series Cross-Validation for Ridge Regress. Models](https://github.com/GBlanch/Time-Series-Cross-Validation-for-a-RR-model/blob/main/TSCV%20for%20a%20RR%20model.ipynb)
 + [Expectation-Maximization algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models ](https://github.com/GBlanch/Statistical-Methods/tree/main/2.Expect.%E2%80%93Max.%20algorithm%20for%20GMMs)



For the curious, you could also take a peek at some of the methodologies I reviewed on **[Multivariable Calculus](https://github.com/GBlanch/Multivar.-calculus-on-AFM/tree/main#potential-flow)** during that time.
