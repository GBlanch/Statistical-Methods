In this repo, I delve into some of the core concepts of Statistics and Probability I took during my [Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering](https://github.com/GBlanch/Portfolio/blob/main/0.Files/A.Transcripts/0.WES%20Course-by-Course%20report/readme.md). Without that essential knowledge, it would have been tougher to catch up with the most common methodologies utilized in Data Science and Machine Learning.

 + ### [Expectation-Maximization algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models ](https://github.com/GBlanch/Statistical-Methods/blob/main/2.Expect.%E2%80%93Max.%20algorithm%20for%20GMMs/EM%20for%20GMM_2.ipynb)
 + ### [Statistical Hypothesis Testing for an A/B Test](https://github.com/GBlanch/Statistical-Methods/blob/main/3.Stat._Hypoth._Testing_for_an_AB_Test/Stat._Hypoth._Testing_AB_Test.ipynb)



For the curious, you could also take a peek at some of the methodologies I reviewed on **[Multivariable Calculus](https://github.com/GBlanch/Multivar.-calculus-on-AFM/tree/main#potential-flow)** during that time.
